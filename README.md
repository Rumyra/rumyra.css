# rumyra.css

Brand CSS Styles for Ruth John / Rumyra pens, demos, blog, apps, websites, talks etc...

You do not have permission to use, modify, or share this code

## Notes

I'm only using sass to compile a final css file to use remotely

In the `styles` directory

`sass rumyra.scss rumyra.css`

Regular fonts.scss is using codepen to host font files

### TODOS

- Sort out a system that utilises both a compiled accessible css file for demos on other platforms, one for local demos and starter files for bigger projects
	- Demo version should include page styles like body padding
	- Have a shared-styles folder and different compilations for different css files to use - MAKE
